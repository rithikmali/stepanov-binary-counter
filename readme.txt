Data Structures:
    I have used 3 structures,
    - Column node aka cnode, is to represent the columns
    - Main node aka mnode which has max element and list of elements that it was compared with
    - Track node aka tnode, which is used to track the nodes that the main node was compared with 

I have used math.h, so please compile it accordingly.

Learned how to make a binary counter, using linked lists.
